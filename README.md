# opx-common-utils
This repository contains a utilities library used by the OpenSwitch OPX project for thread queues, mutex support, andÂ  other items. It is recommended that all utility code - used by more then one OPX component - be placed in this repository.

For example, the event service used by the CPS. The API that starts, stops, and the infrastructure for events are in the _event_ sources, while the user code is in the opx-cps repo.

## Build
