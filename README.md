# sonic-common-utils

## Description

This repo contains a utilities library used by the OPX project for thread queues, mutex
support, andÂ  other items. 
It is recommended that all utility code - used by more then one OPX component -
be placed in this repo.

Example - the
event service used by the CPS. The API that starts, stops, and the
infrastructure for events are in the "event" sources while the user
code is in the opx-cps repo.
